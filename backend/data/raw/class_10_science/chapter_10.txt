The Human Eye and
the Colourful World10 CHAPTER
You have studied in the pr evious chapter about r efraction of light by
lenses. Y ou also studied the natur
e, position and relative size of
images formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of
the human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects
around us. It has a lens in its structure.  What is the function of the lens
in a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of
vision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter .
We have lear nt in the pr evious chapter about light and some of its
properties. In this chapter , we shall use these ideas to study some of the
optical phenomena in natur e. We shall also discuss about rainbow
formation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.
10.1 THE HUMAN EYE
The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.
It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On
closing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,
taste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however , impossible to identify
colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human
eye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,
colourful world around us.
The human eye is like a camera.  Its lens
system forms an image on a light-sensitive
screen called the retina. Light enters the eye
through a thin membrane called the cornea.
It forms the transparent bulge on the front
surface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.
The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape
with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the
refraction for the light rays entering the eye
occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The
crystalline lens merely provides the finer
adjustment of focal length required to focus
objects at dif ferent distances on the r etina. W e find a structur e called iris
behind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the
size of the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light

Science 162entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object
on the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous
number of light-sensitive cells.  The light-sensitive cells get activated
upon illumination and generate electrical signals.  These signals are
sent to the brain via the optic nerves.  The brain interprets these signals,
and finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as
they are.
10.1.1 Power of Accommodation
The eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature
can be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the
curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the
muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length
increases.  This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are
looking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This
incr
eases the curvatur e of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker .
Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases.  This enables
us to see nearby objects clearly.
The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called
accommodation.  However , the focal length of the eye lens cannot be
decreased below a certain minimum limit.  T ry to r ead a printed page by
holding it very close to your eyes. Y ou may see the image being blurred
or feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you
must hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  The minimum distance, at
which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the
least distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.
For a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about
25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is
called the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a nor mal eye. Y ou may note
here a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and
infinity.
Sometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and
cloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete
loss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.

Sometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.
In such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and
comfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects
of the eye.
There are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These
are (i) myopia or near -sightedness, (ii) Hyper metr opia or far -
sightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia.  These defects can be corrected by
the use of suitable spherical lenses. W e discuss below these defects
and their correction.

The Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 163(a)Myopia
Myopia is also known as near -
sightedness. A person with myopia
can see nearby objects clearly but
cannot see distant objects distinctly.
A person with this defect has the far
point nearer than infinity. Such a
person may see clearly upto a
distance of a few metres. In a myopic
eye, the image of a distant object is
formed in front of the retina [Fig.
10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.
This defect may arise due to (i)
excessive curvature of the eye lens,
or (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This
defect can be corrected by using a
concave lens of suitable power . This
is illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A
concave lens of suitable power will
bring the image back on to the
retina and thus the defect is corrected.
(b)Hypermetropia
Hyper metropia is also known as far -sightedness.
A person with hypermetropia can see distant
objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects
distinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther
away from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a
person has to keep a reading material much
beyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable
reading. This is because the light rays from a
closeby object are focussed at a point behind the
retina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b). This defect arises
either because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is
too long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.
This defect can be corrected by using a convex
lens of appr
opriate power . This is illustrated in
Fig. 10.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses
provide the additional focussing power required
for forming the image on the retina.
(c)   Presbyopia
The power of accommodation of the eye usually
decreases with ageing. For most people, the near
point gradually recedes away. They find it difficult
to see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly
without corrective eye-glasses.  This defect is
called Presbyopia.  It arises due to the gradualFigure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2

Do you know that our eyes can live even after our death? By donating our eyes after we
die, we can light the life of a blind person.
About 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can be
cured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through corneal
transplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below the
age of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who does
not have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated?
/square6Eye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or those
operated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, have
hypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also
donate eyes.weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the
eye lens.  Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and
hypermetropia.  Such people often require bi-focal lenses. A common
type of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.
The upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distant
vision. The lower part is a convex lens.  It facilitates near vision.
  These days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects with
contact lenses or through surgical interventions.

You have lear nt how light gets r efracted thr
ough a rectangular glass
slab. For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray
is parallel to the incident ray.  However , it is slightly displaced laterally.
How would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a
triangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular
lateral sur faces. These sur faces are inclined to each other . The angle
between its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now
do an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass
prism./square6Eyes must be removed within 4-6 hours after death. Inform the nearest eye bank
immediately.
/square6The eye bank team will remove the eyes at the home of the deceased or at a hospital.
/square6Eye removal takes only 10-15 minutes. It is a simple process and does not lead to
any disfigurement.
/square6Persons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies,
acute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes.
An eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated are
evaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable for
transplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identities
of both the donor and the recipient remain confidential.
One pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.

(see Fig. 10.4). Similarly, join and produce the points R and S.  Let
these lines meet the boundary of the prism at E and F , respectively.

/square6Take a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow
slit in its middle.
/square6Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam
of white light.
/square6Now, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on
one of its faces as shown in Fig. 10.5.
/square6Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears
on a nearby screen.
/square6What do you observe? Y ou will find a beautiful band of colours.
Why does this happen?Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the
emergent ray. Y ou may note that a ray of light is entering fr
om air to
glass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards
the normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from
glass to air . Hence it has bent away fr om nor mal. Compar e the angle of
incidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the
prism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?
The peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an
angle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of
deviation. In this case ∠ D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of
deviation in the above activity and measure it.

You must have seen and appr eciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.
How could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the
rainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the
refraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a
glass prism show exciting phenomenon.  Let us find it out through an
activity.PE – Incident ray ∠i – Angle of incidence

The Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 167The prism has probably split the incident
white light into a band of colours.  Note the
colours that appear at the two ends of the
colour band. What is the sequence of colours
that you see on the screen? The various
colours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,
Yellow, Orange and Red, as shown in
Fig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help
you to remember the sequence of colours.
The band of the coloured components of a
light beam is called its spectrum. Y ou might
not be able to see all the colours separately.
Yet something makes each colour distinct fr om the other . The splitting
of light into its component colours is called dispersion.
You have seen that white light is dispersed
into its seven-colour components by a prism.
Why do we get these colours? Different colours
of light bend through different angles with
respect to the incident ray, as they pass
through a prism. The red light bends the least
while the violet the most. Thus the rays of each
colour emerge along different paths and thus
become distinct. It is the band of distinct
colours that we see in a spectrum.
Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain
the spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of
the spectrum of white light further by using another similar
prism. However , he could not get any mor e colours. He
then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position
with respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This
allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through
the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging
from the other side of the second prism. This observation
gave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven
colours.
Any light that gives a spectrum similar to that of
sunlight is often referred to as white light.
A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky
after a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion
of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the
atmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction
opposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like
small prisms. They refract and disperse the incident
sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it
again when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due
to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different
colours reach the observer’s eye.
You can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when
you look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water
fountain, with the Sun behind you.Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism

Atmospheric refraction
effects at sunrise and
sunset10.5     ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION
You might have observed the apparent random wavering or
flickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air
rising above a fir e or a radiator . The air just above the fir e becomes
hotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)
than the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly
less than that of the cooler air . Since the physical conditions of
the refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent
position of the object, as seen thr ough the hot air , fluctuates.
This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction
of light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local
environment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on
a much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.
Twinkling of stars
The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The
starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction
continuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction
occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the
atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position
of the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears
slightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the
horizon (Fig. 10.9). Further , this apparent position of the star is not
stationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions
of the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the
previous paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate
point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from
the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star
fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the
star sometimes appears brighter , and at some other time, fainter , which
is the twinkling effect.
Why don’t the planets twinkle? The p lanets are much
closer to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.
If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number
of point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the
amount of light entering our eye from all the individual
point-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby
nullifying the twinkling effect.
Advance sunrise and delayed sunset
The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual
sunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset
because of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we
mean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.
10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the
Sun with respect to the horizon. The time difference
between actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about
2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at
sunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon .Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9

The Human Eye and the Colour ful W orld 16910.6  SC ATTERING OF LIGHT
The interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several
spectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of
water in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset
are some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous
class, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.
The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.
However , its path becomes visible thr ough a colloidal solution wher e the
size of the particles is r elatively lar ger.
10.6.1 T yndall Effect
The earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.
These particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles
of dust and molecules of air . When a beam of light strikes such fine
particles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,
after being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of
scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect
which you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a
fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.
Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can
also be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense
forest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.
The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering
particles. V ery fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of
larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering
particles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear
white.
10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?
The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size
smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in
scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer
wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8
times greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the
atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter
wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters
our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been
any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears
dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not
prominent at such heights.
You might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights ar e red in colour .
Do you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,
it can be seen in the same colour at a distance.

Science 170What y ou hav e learnt
/square6The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its
focal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.
/square6The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is
called the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.  For a young
adult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.
/square6The common refractive defects of vision include myopia, hypermetropia and
presbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness – the image of distant objects is focussed
befor e the r etina) is corr ected by using a concave lens of suitable power .
Hyper metropia (far -sightedness – the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond
the retina) is corr
ected by using a convex lens of suitable power . The eye loses its
power of accommodation at old age.
/square6The splitting of white light into its component colours is called dispersion.
/square6Scattering of light causes the blue colour of sky.
